# Micro SolidWorks

Micro SolidWorks is an educational project for progressively learning and
implementing the foundations of a small 3D parametric CAD application in C++.
It is not intended to provide compatibility with the commercial SolidWorks
product.

## Current stable baseline

**B0 — Foundation** is frozen. The repository provides the executable B0
foundation and application shell; CAD functionality is not implemented yet.

The next baseline is **B1 — Mathematical Foundation**. B1 has not started and
requires explicit authorization.

The approved technology foundation is C++20, CMake, GoogleTest with CTest,
GLFW, OpenGL, and Dear ImGui. Dependencies are introduced only in the increment
that requires them.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Project operating rules are defined in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), with bootstrap
guidance in [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](BOOTSTRAP.md). Architectural and project
documentation is available under [`docs/`](docs/), including the accepted
decision records in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).
